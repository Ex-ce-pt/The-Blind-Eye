# The-Blind-Eye

Platformer/puzzle game. You are an old blind man who was captured by a wizard and locked in a castle. You need to find a way out of his castle. But since you are blind, you can only sense objects, that means that your camera is locked on one object at a time. And you have to find your way out.
